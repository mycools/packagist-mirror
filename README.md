If you're using [PHP Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), commands like *create-project*, *require*, *update*, *remove* are often used. When those commands are executed, Composer will download information from the packages that are needed also from dependent packages. The number of json files downloaded depends on the complexity of the packages which are going to be used. The further you are from the location of the [packagist.org](packagist.org) server, the more time is needed to download json files. By using mirror, it will help save the time for downloading because the server location is closer.

[![World Map](/resources/public/world_map.svg)](https://packagist.com.br/world_map.svg)

The colors represent the topology drawn below, only show servers in better condition at country level.

## 🚀 Create your own mirror

[![Topology](/resources/public/network.svg)](https://packagist.com.br/network.svg)

With docker and nginx:

The mirror creation save all data as .gz to save disk space and CPU, you need to enable reverse gz decode when a client ask for the decompressed version, normally used only for legacy composer clients.

Change you [nginx configuration](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/) of [*gzip_static*](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html) and [*gunzip*](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html) as is:

Create a website on a default nginx instalattion:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/packagist.com.br.conf
```

```bash
server {
    index.html;

    server_name packagist.com.br www.packagist.com.br;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        gzip_static on;
        gunzip on;
    }
}
```

💡Tip: use a machine with 2GB at least of memory, with that all metadata keep to the memory helping the nginx and disk to not be consumed at all.

After install nginx edit `/etc/crontab`:

```bash
* * * * * root docker run --name mirror --rm -v /var/www:/public \
-e MAINTAINER_REPO='packagist.com.br' \
-e APP_COUNTRY_NAME='Brazil' \
-e APP_COUNTRY_NAME='br' \
-e MAINTAINER_MIRROR='Webysther' \
-e MAINTAINER_PROFILE='https://github.com/Webysther' \
-e MAINTAINER_REPO='https://github.com/Webysther/packagist-mirror' \
-e URL='packagist.com.br' \
webysther/packagist-mirror
```
to more options about image go to [docker repository](https://github.com/Webysther/packagist-mirror-docker).

Put inside your `~/.*rc` (`~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`/`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```bash
alias logs='watch -n 0.5 docker logs --tail 10 -t mirror'
```

Update your env vars and see monitoring packagist mirror creation:
```bash
source ~/.*rc
logs
```
